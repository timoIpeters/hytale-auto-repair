# Hytale Auto-Repair Mod

Using this mod, you can prevent tools from breaking by automatically using repair kits from your inventory.

## Base Features

- `/autorepair` command to toggle the auto-repair feature
- if the auto-repair feature is enabled and a tool in your inventory breaks, it will automatically be repaired as long as you have a repair kit in your inventory
- You get a chat message when an item is auto-repaired
- The `/autorepair` state (enabled/disabled) will be persisted, so that leaving a server and re-joining keeps the last setting

## How to Download
The mod can be downloaded from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/auto-repair) or [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/hytale/mods/42).
Just add the `.jar` to your server's mods folder (or directly install on your server using the Curseforge UI).

After installing the mod, you can execute the `/autorepair` command in your in-game chat.
You can always toggle this mod on and off by executing `/autorepair` again.

## Possible Future Adjustments

- Add visual effect when auto-repairing a tool
- Add UI to specify which tools should be auto-repaired and which should not (currently every tool will be repaired)
