# Hytale Auto-Repair Mod
https://www.nexusmods.com/hytale/mods/42

Using this mod, you can prevent tools from breaking by automatically using repair kits from your inventory. Here is how it works:

- After installing the mod (by adding it to your Server's mods folder), you can execute the `/autorepair` command in your in-game chat. 
- You can always toggle this mod on and off by executing `/autorepair` again. 
- The auto-repair status is persisted so that it stays the same even after logging out of a server and re-joining

## Possible Future Adjustments

- Add visual effect when auto-repairing a tool
- Add UI to specify which tools should be auto-repaired and which should not (currently every tool will be repaired)
